The installation and setup documentation is available [here](https://www.betahub.io/docs/integration-guides/).

## Features

- **In-game bug submission form**: Easily submit bugs with a form that only asks for a description and steps to reproduce. Titles, priority, and tags are handled by BetaHub's AI algorithms.
- **Video recording**: Record a video of the bug happening in-game. The video is automatically recorded and attached to the bug report.
- **Log collection**: Collect logs from the game and attach them to the bug report. By default, Unity logs are collected, but you can also add custom logs.
- **Screenshot of the game**: A screenshot of the game is automatically attached to the bug report when the user submits a bug.
- **Working Example Scene**: The plugin comes with a working example scene that demonstrates how to use the plugin, serving as a good starting point for your implementation.
- **Customizable**: Customize the bug submission form to ask for more information or to change the look and feel of the form.
